# Weird Crypto (Cryptographic Issues)

## Goal
The goal of this challenge is to **identify and report the use of a weak cryptographic algorithm**. It is designed to teach awareness of insecure cryptography practices, such as the use of MD5, and how to recognize them in applications.

## Solution
1. Go to the OWASP Juice Shop challenge page and click on the link to open the **Customer Feedback** section.  
2. In the feedback form, submit a complaint mentioning a **weak cryptographic algorithm**.  
3. Search on Google for examples of weak cryptographic algorithms. Copy **MD5** and paste it into the feedback form.  
4. Fill in the remaining details and submit the form to solve the challenge.
