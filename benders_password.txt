# Extra Language (Broken Anti-Automation)

### Challenge
Add a non-existing language (Klingon) to OWASP Juice Shop by exploiting broken anti-automation in the language selection feature.

---

### Solution Steps

1. Click on the language selector (top-right corner) — observe that changing the language sends requests such as:
/assets/i18n/it_IT.json
/assets/i18n/da_DK.json
/assets/i18n/tr_TR.json

2. Open **Burp Suite** and intercept these requests.  
You’ll see each language corresponds to a JSON file loaded dynamically.

3. Visit Google → search **“OWASP Juice Shop language support crowdin”** → open  
[https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop](https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop)

4. From the list, note that **Klingon** is not an available language.

5. Hover over language flags in Juice Shop → observe URL patterns such as:

https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop/bg
https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-juice-shop/my

6. In **Burp Suite**, send the Turkish request (`/assets/i18n/tr_TR.json`) to **Repeater**.

7. Modify the request:

GET /assets/i18n/tlh_AA.json HTTP/1.1
Host: juice-sh.op

8. Send the request.  
The language will change to **Klingon**, and the challenge will be marked as solved.

### Key Idea
By manually requesting a hidden or non-listed language file (`tlh_AA.json`), the app loads Klingon — revealing a lack of server-side validation for supported locales.
