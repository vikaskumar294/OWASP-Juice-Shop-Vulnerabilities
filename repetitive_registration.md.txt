# OWASP Juice Shop Challenge: Repetitive Registration

## Challenge Description
The **Repetitive Registration** challenge in OWASP Juice Shop requires exploiting the applicationâ€™s weak registration and password reset mechanism. By registering or resetting accounts multiple times, it becomes possible to interfere with existing users or gain unauthorized access.

---

## Steps to Solve

### 1. Create a New Account
- Register a new account with the following details:
  - **Email:** `abcd@juice.shop.com`
  - **Password:** `testtest`

---

### 2. Reset the Password
- Reset the password of the created account:
  - **New Password:** `test`

---

### 3. Target Existing Accounts
- Use the password reset flow to reset passwords of existing accounts:
  - **Admin Account:**  
    - **Email:** `admin@juice-sh.op`  
    - **Password (after reset):** `test@123`  

---

## Outcome
- Successfully created a new account.  
- Exploited the weak reset process to set a known password for an existing account (`admin@juice-sh.op`).  
- Gained unauthorized access, solving the challenge.  

---

## Mitigation (Best Practices)
To prevent this type of vulnerability:
1. Enforce **unique email validation** during registration.  
2. Implement **secure password reset with verification tokens**.  
3. Ensure password reset links are **time-bound and single-use**.  
4. Add **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for sensitive accounts.
